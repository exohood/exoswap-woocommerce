2. A customer wants to buy the item and selects to pay with Exohood.
3. An invoice is generated and, according to the current exchange rate, the price is 0.000075 USD per EXO, so the customer has to pay 1327123 EXO.
4. Once the invoice is paid, the merchant gets a notification and is credited $100 USD (no fees from Exoswap), or 1327123 EXO.
